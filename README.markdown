## Naming


Descriptive and consistent naming makes software easier to read and understand. Use the Swift naming conventions described in the [API Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/). Some key takeaways include:

- striving for clarity at the call site
- prioritizing clarity over brevity
- using `camelCase` (not `snake_case`)
- using `UpperCamelCase` for types and protocols, `lowerCamelCase` for everything else
- using `UpperCamelCase` for Folders in Project's structure or for Folders in Assets
- including all needed words while omitting needless words

**Preferred**:
```swift
extension List {
  public mutating func remove(at position: Index) -> Element
}
employees.remove(at: x)
```
**Not Preferred**:
```swift
employees.remove(x) // unclear: are we removing x?
```

**Preferred**:
```swift
public mutating func remove(_ member: Element) -> Element?

allViews.remove(cancelButton) // clear
```

**Not Preferred**:
```swift
public mutating func removeElement(_ member: Element) -> Element?

allViews.removeElement(cancelButton)
```
- using names based on roles, not types

**Not Preferred**:
```swift
var string = "Hello"
protocol ViewController {
  associatedtype ViewType : View
}
class ProductionLine {
  func restock(from widgetFactory: WidgetFactory)
}
```
**Preferred**:
```swift
var greeting = "Hello"
protocol ViewController {
  associatedtype ContentView : View
}
class ProductionLine {
  func restock(from supplier: WidgetFactory)
}
```
- Prefer method and function names that make use sites form grammatical English phrases.

**Preferred**:
```swift
x.insert(y, at: z)          “x, insert y at z”
x.subViews(havingColor: y)  “x's subviews having color y”
x.capitalizingNouns()       “x, capitalizing nouns”
```
**Not Preferred**:
```swift 
x.insert(y, position: z)
x.subViews(color: y)
x.nounCapitalize()
```
- naming methods for their side effects
  - verb methods follow the -ed, -ing rule for the non-mutating version
  - noun methods follow the formX rule for the mutating version
  - boolean types should read like assertions
  - protocols that describe _what something is_ should read as nouns
  - protocols that describe _a capability_ should end in _-able_ or _-ible_
- using terms that don't surprise experts or confuse beginners
- generally avoiding abbreviations
- using precedent for names
- preferring methods and properties to free functions
- casing acronyms and initialisms uniformly up or down
- giving the same base name to methods that share the same meaning
- avoiding overloads on return type
- choosing good parameter names that serve as documentation
- preferring to name the first parameter instead of including its name in the method name, except as mentioned under Delegates
- labeling closure and tuple parameters
- taking advantage of default parameters
